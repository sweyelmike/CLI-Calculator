## 🔢 CLI Calculator: A Python Implementation

### 🌟 Project Overview

This repository hosts a simple, robust **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Calculator** built entirely in **Python**. Developed as a key assignment during my Python Developer Internship, this application focuses on providing continuous, basic arithmetic functionality—Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

-----

### 🎯 Core Objectives

The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in writing **clean, modular, and maintainable Python code**. Specifically, the implementation leverages:

  * **Functions:** To encapsulate and manage each arithmetic operation.
  * **Loops:** To ensure the calculator runs continuously until the user explicitly exits.
  * **Conditionals (Control Flow):** For decision-making based on user input (operation selection and continuation choice).

-----

### ✨ Key Features

  * **Four Fundamental Operations:** Supports `+` (Addition), `-` (Subtraction), `*` (Multiplication), and `/` (Division).
  * **Modular Design:** Each mathematical operation is implemented as a dedicated, reusable function.
  * **Continuous Operation:** The application utilizes a loop to allow multiple calculations without restarting.
  * **User-Friendly CLI:** Simple, text-based interaction for easy use by beginners.

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Category | Tool / Language |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Programming Language** | **Python 3.x** |
| **Development Environment** | Visual Studio Code (VS Code) |
| **Version Control** | Git & GitHub |
| **Interface** | Command-Line Interface (CLI) |

### ⚙️ Application Workflow

The program follows a straightforward execution cycle:

1.  The user is prompted to input **two numbers** and select the desired **arithmetic operator**.
2.  The program utilizes **conditional logic** to call the corresponding function (e.g., `add()`, `subtract()`, etc.) based on the operator.
3.  The calculated **result** is immediately displayed to the user.
4.  Finally, the user is asked whether they wish to **continue** with another calculation or **exit** the application.

### ▶️ Getting Started (How to Run)

To run this calculator on your local machine, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-calculator-cli.git
```

#### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the newly cloned project folder:

```bash
cd python-calculator-cli
```

#### Step 3: Run the Python Script

Execute the main application file (assuming it's named `calculator.py` or similar):

```bash
python calculator.py
```

*(Note: You might need to use `python3` instead of `python` depending on your system configuration.)*
